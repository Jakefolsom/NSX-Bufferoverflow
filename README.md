# NSX-Bufferoverflow

## What is it?
During the NSA NSX in the reverse engeenerring section there was a program that needed to be exploited to get the flag. Upon looking at the program in Ghidra it was apperent that the program was vulnerable to a buffer overflow style attack. This would be a quicker way then rewriting the crypted assembly/c code ghidra had created.
